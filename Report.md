## Tasks Breakdown
<!-- 16. An identification of all the tasks that are performed by the system with their method of implementation, thread or interrupt -->

## Time Analysis
<!-- 17. A characterisation of each task with its theoretical minimum initiation interval and measured maximum execution time
18. A critical instant analysis of the rate monotonic scheduler, showing that all deadlines are met under worst-case conditions  -->

## Data and Resource Sharing
<!-- 20. An identification of all the shared data structures and the methods used to guarantee safe accessand synchronisation -->

## Dependency
<!-- 21. An analysis of inter-task blocking dependencies that shows any possibility of deadlock -->

## CPU utilisation
<!-- 19. A quantification of total CPU utilisation  -->
